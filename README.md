# UNLV-ATLAS-1

UNLV ATLAS-1 is an independent research project at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, dedicated to making high-altitude ballooning tests and CubeSat development more accessible and attainable within the Nevada region.

This GitHub repository documents our ongoing progress toward our mission: to design, build, and launch a CubeSat from the state of Nevada. Our goal is not only to showcase innovation but also to strengthen Nevada’s presence in the aerospace industry. We are currently developing ATLAS-1, an open-source mock satellite (“mocksat”) that enables high-altitude balloon launches on a budget. All source files and resources for this project can be found here.

We would like to acknowledge jhammerberg’s qbSat-v2, whose original mocksat design served as the foundation upon which ATLAS-1 was developed and improved.

We encourage others to explore our design—modify it, build upon it, and make it their own.

Through this project, we aim to inspire future engineers and establish Nevada as a recognized contributor to the global space community.
